This web app is based on the definition of Getting It Together, as developed by the Ladies A, C, and E. In this definition, Togetherness is broken down into seven pillars:

1. Physical Togetherness (PT): taking care of one's body
2. Emotional Togetherness (ET): taking care of one's emotions
3. Organizational Togetherness (OT): taking care of one's space
4. Interpersonal Togetherness (IT): taking care of one's relationships
5. Boundary-Setting (B): taking care of one's priorities
6. Financial Togetherness (FT): taking care of one's finances
7. Flexibility (F): adapting to those things that are out of one's control

The Ladies would like to emphasize that Togetherness is an ongoing, iterative process. It is not a specific person, place, or state of perfection. Togetherness is a concept, and a journey that the Ladies envision themselves traversing for their entire lives. The Definition is not intended to be a restrictive document, but rather a set of guiding ideas to help shape the hard work of self-improvement.
