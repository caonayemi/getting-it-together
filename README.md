#Getting It Together

##The Definition

The following is a working document that explores the meaning of Togetherness, as defined by the Ladies A, C, and E.

The Ladies would like to emphasize that Togetherness is an ongoing, iterative process. It is not a specific person, place, or state of perfection. Togetherness is a concept, and a journey that the Ladies envision themselves traversing for their entire lives. The Definition is not intended to be a restrictive document, but rather a set of guiding ideas to help shape the hard work of self-improvement.

Edited and ratified December 30, 2014 by unanimous vote of the membership, to date.

##As a Together Person I strive to…

###Take care of my body.

Characteristics of Physical Togetherness (PT):

* Develop good habits that give my body the energy I need to address other aspects of Togetherness.  I prioritize these habits by:
  - Sleeping — getting enough sleep at regular intervals; maintaining a consistent sleep schedule whenever possible
  - Eating — maintaining a well-balanced diet complete with the nutrients my body needs; eating at regular intervals that complement my daily schedule
  - Exercising — regularly engaging in the physical activities that keep me strong and energetic
  - Hygiene — bathing, brushing teeth, flossing, etc.; I am physically presentable when I go out into the world
* Maintain my body through regular doctor visits and self-examinations.
* Be in tune with my body and recognize its needs and signals.

###Take care of my emotions.

Characteristics of Emotional Togetherness (ET):

* Improve emotional perspective- “the capacity to view things in their true relations or relative importance.”
* Recognize the extent to which I have emotional choices in different situations.
  - Make an effort to choose positive emotions when possible.
  - Exercise agency to change situations when necessary. (e.g. Difficult Conversations)
* Be forward thinking. I work to define and take deliberate steps toward my long-term future, while accepting that those plans may not always come to fruition.
* Be kind to myself; I cut myself slack when necessary, and kick my own butt when needed.
* Be in tune with my emotions.  This means:
  - I can identify my emotions and take time to contemplate their causes and implications.
  - I carve out time, mental space, and energy for addressing ET in my life.
  - I have identified a specific set of personal strategies to implement when I am feeling bad, and I use them.
  - I recognize that feeling like a grown-up and doing the grown-up thing may not always coincide.
  - I can maintain other areas of Togetherness while coping with outside forces that negatively impact my emotions.

###Take care of my space.

Characteristics of Organizational Togetherness (OT):

* Be able to get my hands on whatever I need whenever I need it; my organizational systems complement my personality, sense of style, and daily routines.
* Have addressed the organization of my:
  - Home
  - Closets and Clothes
  - Office
  - Automobile
  - Schedule
  - Documents
  - Finances
  - Purse and/or Wallet
  - Storage
  - Electronic Device(s)
  - Digital Storage

###Take care of my relationships.

* Acknowledge and demonstrate the value of the people I love.
* Be reliable and treat people with kindness and respect.
* Maintain regular contact with my friends and family and make time for those people.
* Make and return phone calls and emails in a timely fashion.
* Remember important dates/events, and acknowledge those events through thoughtful gestures.
* Hold others and myself to realistic expectations in the context of our relationship.

###Prioritize.

* Understand that my time and energy are valuable, and I am therefore capable of deciding what things are and are not worth that time and energy.
* Avoid encumbrance by negative obligations, because I recognize my time commitments as individual choices.
* Rest when I need to rest.
* Keep a clear and organized schedule.  I budget my time appropriately; I am reliable and punctual.

###Take care of my finances.

Characteristics of Financial Togetherness (FT):

* Have a plan for my money.  I have balanced my spending against my income and live comfortably.
* Have my financial documents in order and easily accessible.  I have a reliable system for paying bills and handling other financial obligations regularly and on time.
* Keep my purse well-stocked and organized.  Much like my OT, I can get my hands on whatever I need from my purse at any given time.

###Be flexible.

Characteristics of Flexibility:

* Realize that not all things, nor the actions of others, are in my control.
* Recognize that sometimes plans need to change, and sometimes events that are out of my control take precedence.
* Adapt my goals and create realistic expectations for the REAL reality of different situations.

####As a Together Person, I recognize that not all things are in my control, and I strive to get those things that are in my control under control.
