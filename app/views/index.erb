<h1>Getting It Together</h1>
<h2>The Definition</h2>
<p>
  The following is a working document that explores the meaning of Togetherness, as defined by the Ladies A, C, and E.
</p>
<p>
  The Ladies would like to emphasize that Togetherness is an ongoing, iterative process. It is not a specific person, place, or state of perfection. Togetherness is a concept, and a journey that the Ladies envision themselves traversing for their entire lives. The Definition is not intended to be a restrictive document, but rather a set of guiding ideas to help shape the hard work of self-improvement.

<h2>As a Together Person I strive to…</h2>
<h3>Take care of my body.</h3>
<p>Characteristics of <span class="pillar-name">Physical Togetherness (PT)</span>:
  <ul class="characteristics">
    <li>
      Develop good habits that give my body the energy I need to address other aspects of Togetherness.  I prioritize these habits by:
      <ul class="sub-points">
        <li><strong>Sleeping</strong> — getting enough sleep at regular intervals; maintaining a consistent sleep schedule whenever possible</li>
        <li><strong>Eating</strong> — maintaining a well-balanced diet complete with the nutrients my body needs; eating at regular intervals that complement my daily schedule</li>
        <li><strong>Exercising</strong> — regularly engaging in the physical activities that keep me strong and energetic</li>
        <li><strong>Hygiene</strong> — bathing, brushing teeth, flossing, etc.; I am physically presentable when I go out into the world</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Maintain my body through regular doctor visits and self-examinations.</li>
    <li>Be in tune with my body and recognize its needs and signals.</li>
